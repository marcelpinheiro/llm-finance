# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential enhancements and advanced techniques that could be implemented to further improve the Financial Data Copilot.

## üöÄ Advanced ML Techniques

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

#### Overview
Supervised Fine-Tuning involves training a pre-trained language model on a specific dataset of input-output pairs to improve its performance on domain-specific tasks.

#### Application to Financial Data Copilot
For this project, SFT could be applied to:
- **Query Understanding**: Fine-tune a model on financial query examples to better understand domain-specific terminology
- **SQL Generation**: Train on financial question-to-SQL pairs for more accurate query generation
- **Response Formatting**: Optimize responses for financial data presentation

#### Implementation Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather dataset of financial questions paired with correct SQL queries
2. **Model Selection**: Choose a base model (e.g., Llama, Mistral) for fine-tuning
3. **Training Process**: 
   - Format data as instruction-response pairs
   - Use Hugging Face's transformers library for training
   - Implement LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
4. **Evaluation**: Test on held-out financial queries

#### Benefits
- Better understanding of financial terminology and concepts
- More accurate SQL query generation for complex financial questions
- Improved handling of domain-specific query patterns

#### Challenges
- Requires significant labeled training data
- Computational resources for training
- Model maintenance and updates

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

#### Overview
RLHF trains models to optimize responses based on human preferences rather than just supervised labels.

#### Application to Financial Data Copilot
RLHF could enhance:
- **Response Quality**: Train the model to generate more helpful financial insights
- **Tone and Style**: Optimize for professional financial communication
- **Risk Communication**: Better handling of uncertainty and risk disclosures

#### Implementation Approach
1. **Preference Data Collection**: Gather human rankings of response quality
2. **Reward Model Training**: Train a model to predict human preferences
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Use PPO or similar algorithms to optimize the language model
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously collect feedback and retrain

#### Benefits
- More natural, conversational responses
- Better alignment with user expectations
- Improved handling of edge cases and ambiguous queries

#### Challenges
- Complex implementation requiring expertise in RL
- Ongoing human feedback collection
- Computational intensity of training process
